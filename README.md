# Dimensionality-Reduction
This repository contains implementation of different dimensionality reduction techniques on different datasets.
Supervised dimensionality reduction techniques like Linear Discriminant Analysis and Neighbourhood component analysis are implemented. Unsupervised dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis and Singular Value Decomposition were also implemented.
The performance of different dimensionality reduction techniques was compared by evaluating on different classifiers.
